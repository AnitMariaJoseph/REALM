REALM: Your Choice Home

INTRODUCTION:
Real estate is a full-fledged business, around the globe, employing millions of people who are called realtors. My project involves the making of a website that deals with online residential real estate business. I plan to make it in a simple but informative manner such a way that it can be helpful for those looking out for buying or selling a living space.
NEEDS:
The rise in popularity towards online dealings and its benefits lead to the proposal of this website which can act as a platform to help make the real estate dealing more easy and fast.
OBJECTIVES:
The main goal of my project is to provide a space for both potential buyers and sellers to share their requirements and demands as well as share the pictures of their prospective homes. This website is designed in such a way as to give the customers the freedom they require to find a place of their choice.
WEBSITE ORGANISATION:
This website consists of mainly four pages:
•	Home : It is the main page of the website which gives an introductory idea and the services offered by the website.
•	Services : This page offers separate spaces for buyers and sellers. If possible another section for rentals can also be included in these pages.
•	Realtors : This page helps you to meet with a real estate agent of your choice, to know in detail about the buying and selling procedures, in person. This page may include an appointment booking section also.
•	Contact us :This page gives the user a chance to provide feedback about the dealing and the website in general. It will also include the necessary contact details of the firm.
PRELIMINARY DESIGN:
This website will be created and designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
SUMMARY
